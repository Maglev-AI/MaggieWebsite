For many, the thought of soaring through the skies can trigger a complex mix of emotions. 
While flying is statistically the safest mode of transportation, it doesn't feel that way to everyone. 
Fear of flying, or aviophobia, can stem from various sources, ranging from a fear of turbulence to claustrophobia. 
For those with a fear of flying, the thought of getting on a plane can induce feelings of anxiety, dread, and panic. 
But with the help of talk therapy, you can take control of your fear and enjoy air travel again.

## üò® What Causes Fear of Flying? 

Fear of flying, also known as aviophobia or aerophobia, is a complex phobia. 
It may be triggered by multiple factors:
- Fear of plane crashes and terrorism
- Fear of tight, enclosed spaces
- Fear of not being in control
- Fear of turbulence
- General anxiety about the unknown

Through talk therapy, you can identify the specific triggers underlying your fear and develop customized coping strategies. 
Your therapist may use cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) to help replace negative thought patterns with more realistic thinking. 
Relaxation techniques like deep breathing can help lower anxiety levels.

## üí™ Tips to Overcome Fear of Flying 

Here are some useful tips and techniques to cope with flight anxiety:
- Arrive early to the airport to allow extra time and feel in control.
- Distract yourself with a book, music, or movie during the flight.
- Avoid alcohol before flying as it can amplify anxiety.
- Practice deep breathing exercises while in flight to manage feelings of panic.
- Visualize a calm, safe airplane ride. Positive visualization can help reframe fearful thoughts.
- Learn about air travel safety from reputable sources. Having facts can alleviate exaggerated fears of crashes.
- Take an over-the-counter sedative if prescribed by your physician to ease severe anxiety.


## üåä Managing Your Fear of Turbulence

Turbulence is a common cause of in-flight anxiety. 
While turbulence can be alarming, remember that modern planes are extremely durable and able to withstand even severe turbulence. 
Focus on staying centered:
- Listen to the pilot's updates about expectations of turbulence.
- Use breathing techniques and meditation during patches of turbulence.
- Avoid watching tense in-flight movies that could amplify anxiety.
- Trust in the pilot's ability to navigate turbulence safely.
- Constantly remind yourself that turbulence is uncomfortable but not dangerous.


## üõó Coping with Claustrophobia

The cramped quarters of an airplane cabin can be triggering if you tend to feel claustrophobic. 
Try these tips:
- Book an aisle seat so you can move more freely.
- Close your eyes during the flight and imagine yourself somewhere open and expansive.
- Distract yourself with a movie, book or music.
- Breathe slowly and deeply into your stomach.
- Talk to your therapist about anti-anxiety medication if your claustrophobia is severe.


## üèñÔ∏è Relaxation Techniques for Flyers

It's key to have some relaxation go-tos ready for when you feel anxious at any point during your air travel experience.

- Do progressive muscle relaxation by tensing and relaxing muscle groups.
- Use guided imagery, picturing a peaceful scene like a beach.
- Listen to a meditation or calming music with headphones.
- Use acupressure, applying gentle pressure to spots like your inner wrist.
- Try square breathing - breath in for 4 counts, hold for 4, exhale for 4.
